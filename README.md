# Weekly Project — Simple Express API

This small project is an Express.js server that exposes two simple API endpoints. It's intended as a learning project to practice Node.js, Express, environment variables, and using VS Code as your IDE.

**What you'll achieve with this repo**
- Run a minimal Express server that returns JSON from two endpoints.
- Use a `.env` file to configure the server port.
- Use VS Code to edit, run, and debug the server.
- Use Git to commit and push changes to the remote repository.

**Files of interest**
- `server.js` — main Express application. Endpoints:
  - `GET /api/name` — returns name, email, and tasks.
  - `GET /api/contact` — returns contact details.
- `.env` — environment variables (not committed). Example: `PORT=3000`.
- `.gitignore` — ignores `node_modules`, logs, `.env`, editor settings, and build output.
- `package.json` — includes a `start` script (`node server.js`).

Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16+ recommended) and npm installed.
- Git configured with a remote (the repository already includes a `repository` field in `package.json`).
- VS Code (optional, recommended) with the Node.js extension for helpful tooling.

Quick setup & run

1. Open the project folder in VS Code:

    - `File -> Open Folder...` and choose this project directory.

2. Install dependencies (run in the project root terminal):

```powershell
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the project root (if not present) and add a port value: 

```text
PORT=3000
```

4. Start the server:

```powershell
npm start
# or
node server.js
```

5. Visit the endpoints in your browser or with curl/Postman:

```powershell
curl http://localhost:3000/api/name
curl http://localhost:3000/api/contact
```

Using VS Code effectively
- Run in the integrated terminal: open `Terminal -> New Terminal` and use `npm start`.
- Use the Run & Debug view to create a debug configuration if you want breakpoints. A simple `launch.json` for Node is provided by VS Code when you choose "Node.js" -> "Launch Program" and select `server.js`.
- Install helpful extensions: ESLint, Prettier, Node.js Extension Pack (optional).

Environment variables
- This project uses `dotenv` to load `.env`. Keep `.env` out of source control — it's listed in `.gitignore`.

Testing endpoints
- Use your browser at `http://localhost:3000/api/name` and `/api/contact`.
- Or use curl or Postman as shown above.

Git: commit & push (example commands)

```powershell
git add README.md
git commit -m "Add README with setup and usage"
git push
```

Notes & next steps
- Add more endpoints as you learn Express routing and middleware.
- Add validations and tests (e.g., with Jest or Mocha + Supertest).
- Optionally add a `start:dev` script with `nodemon` for automatic reload.

If you'd like, I can:
- Add a `launch.json` for debugging in VS Code.
- Add a `start:dev` script and `nodemon` to `devDependencies`.
- Run the git commit & push for you now.
